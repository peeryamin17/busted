# BugSeek AI

AI-powered security reconnaissance for bug bounty hunters. A Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that passively maps a target's attack surface, plus an optional backend that runs an autonomous AI agent swarm for deeper active testing.

## What it does

**Passive recon** — runs entirely in the extension, no backend needed:

- DOM analysis: forms, inputs, hidden fields, iframes, HTML comments, inline event handlers, DOM XSS sinks
- Secret scanning: hardcoded AWS keys, Stripe keys, API tokens, private keys, JWTs and more in page JavaScript
- Cookie audit: missing `Secure` / `HttpOnly` / `SameSite` flags, overly broad domain scoping
- Security headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options and friends checked against OWASP best practices
- Tech fingerprinting: frameworks, CMS and server software from headers, meta tags and script URLs
- One-click Markdown report with severity-grouped findings and remediation advice

**Active testing** — locked until you confirm authorization (bug bounty program, pentest contract, or ownership) and define the scope:

- CORS misconfigurations, GraphQL introspection, reflected XSS, IDOR, auth posture, API endpoint discovery
- Every request goes through scope checks and a rate limiter — nothing fires outside what you authorized
- CVSS v3.1 scoring on every finding, honeypot/trap detection, and attack-chain narratives that link findings into bigger stories
- Deep Inspect mode: opt-in capture of response bodies via the Chrome DevTools protocol, for hunting secrets and debug output leaked in API responses

**AI agent swarm** (backend) — a head agent deploys specialist worker agents (recon, secrets, headers, CORS, XSS, IDOR, auth, GraphQL, source-map miner) that probe the target autonomously and report back. The head agent dedupes their findings, chains them, and writes the summary. High and critical findings also get AI-generated suggested code fixes in the report.

```bash
cd backend && npx tsx src/multiagent/cli.ts --target https://example.com
```

## Build the extension

```bash
npm install
npm run build   # output goes to dist/
```

Then in Chrome: `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer mode → Load unpacked → select `dist/`. Reload any tabs that were already open, open the popup on a target you're authorized to test, and hit **Scan this page**.

## Run the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # add your GEMINI_API_KEY
npm run dev
```

The extension works fully standalone — the backend just adds AI deepening and the agent swarm. Save your backend API key in the extension popup (Active tab) to connect them.

## Try it on something safe

Only ever scan targets you own or are authorized to test. [OWASP Juice Shop](https://juice-shop.github.io/) is the classic practice target:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
# then scan http://localhost:3000
```

## Pricing

Scout (free, 50 credits/month), Hunter ($29/mo, 300 credits), Pro ($99/mo, 1500 credits). Passive scans cost 1 credit, agent scans cost 25. See `docs/business-plan.md` for the full model.
